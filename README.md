# Crosstalk-Cancellation-
This crosstalk algorithm is based upon Atal &amp; Schroeder’s “Apparent Sound Source Translator” from 1962, which is the first invention of the crosstalk cancellation system. This model makes it possible to cancel out unwanted sound coming from a speaker to contralateral ear, and to send a delayed and inverted signal to the other speaker. This gives the possibility of playing binaural audio from speakers.
