# Crosstalk-Cancellation-
This crosstalk algorithm is based upon Atal &amp; Schroeder’s “Apparent Sound Source Translator” from 1962. This models follows the same system, cancelling out unwanted sound coming from a speaker to the contralateral ear, by sending a delayed and inverted signal from the other speaker. 

The algorithm is following the same model, but further tweaks in time delay and frequency attenuation is still needed to make the cancellation operate smoothly.
